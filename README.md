**PROTOTYPE**

**The Problem**
Most "accessibility" tools for the Deaf community are one-way streets. They focus on translating Sign Language into Text for hearing people. However, they ignore the reverse loop:

Text is not the native language of the Deaf. Many Deaf individuals prefer Sign Language over reading English text.

Lack of Emotion. Text captures words, but Sign Language relies heavily on facial expressions and body language ("Non-Manual Markers").

The Communication Loop is Broken. A hearing person cannot "sign back" without years of training.

💡 **The Solution**
Sign-Bridge is a bi-directional communication platform **Singnlingua.AI**.

Hearing-to-Deaf (The USP): Translates spoken audio into grammatically correct Sign Language (Gloss) performed by a hyper-realistic 3D Avatar with facial expressions.

Deaf-to-Hearing: Uses computer vision to track hand gestures and converts them into spoken speech.

🚀** Key Features**
🗣️ Real-Time Speech-to-Sign: Converts spoken English into ISL/ASL Gloss (Sign Language Grammar) using an LLM, not just word-for-word translation.

🤖 3D Neural Avatar: A WebGL-based avatar (Ready Player Me) that performs signs seamlessly.

😊 Sentiment & Emotion Sync: If the speaker sounds happy or concerned, the Avatar's facial expressions change accordingly (Brows up, smiling, frowning).

🏥 Medical/Emergency Mode: A high-accuracy mode for doctors and patients with pre-loaded, critical medical vocabulary.

⚡ Latency Optimized: Built on Groq/Deepgram for near-instant response times.
